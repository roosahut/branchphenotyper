## Branchphenotyper, a tool where scientists can automatically estimate tree branch architecture

This is a project for the Data Science Project 2025 -course.

# Run the data augmentation functions

``pip install -r requirements.txt``

and then run the data_augmentation.py file. I added one image, B-1.jpg and one augmented image to the repo so you will have the correct project struture and one example image to run the program.
