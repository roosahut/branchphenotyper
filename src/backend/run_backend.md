To run the backend locally create a python virtual environment (need to have python3 on your laptop)

```bash
cd src/backend
```

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Access the virtual environment

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Load the requirements in the virtual environment

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In the backend folder and in the virtual environment run this to start the backend

```bash
python3 main.py
```

To use the whole app you need to have both backend and frontend running!
