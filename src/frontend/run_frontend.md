To run frontend locally, you need a relatively new node version on your computer (nvm is a good package for handling node versions).

To run the frontend, you need to run these commands in the frontend folder.

```bash
npm i
```

and then

```bash
npm run dev
```

To use the whole app you need to have both backend and frontend running!
